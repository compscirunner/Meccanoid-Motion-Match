## Conversation Summary (as of 2025-05-11 ~22:55 PST)

**TASK DESCRIPTION:**
The primary goal is to create an interactive "Simon Says" game named "Meccanoid Motion Match." A Meccanoid 2.0 robot will perform poses, and a player, tracked via webcam and pose estimation, will mimic them. The game will feature audiovisual feedback on a TV and be controlled via the Meccanoid's native brain using Python.
The current focus has been on Phase II: Meccanoid Robot Control Module, specifically testing eye color control and integrating AI-assisted verification for these tests using a local Ollama model (`gemma3:12b-it-qat` via `http://localhost:11434/`). A new requirement to power cycle the robot via Home Assistant for testing has been mentioned.

**COMPLETED:**
1.  **Project Planning & Setup (Phase I, Step 1 & 2 from `ai-tasks.md`):**
    *   Reviewed `ai-tasks.md`.
    *   Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
    *   Established Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
    *   Installed core libraries (`bleak`, `mediapipe`, `pygame`, `opencv-python`, `requests`) and generated/updated `requirements.txt`.
    *   Created project directory structure.
    *   Initialized `README.md` and `.gitignore`.
2.  **Meccanoid Protocol Documentation (`docs/meccanoid_protocol.md`):**
    *   Analyzed user-provided code to document BLE UUIDs, command format, and checksum calculation.
3.  **Bluetooth LE Connection Script (`src/meccanoid_ble.py`):**
    *   Created and successfully tested script to scan and connect to the Meccanoid.
4.  **Robot Control Module (`src/robot_control.py`):**
    *   Major refactoring to align with the 20-byte Meccanoid protocol.
    *   Implemented internal state management and methods for handshake, servo positions, eye color, servo LED colors, and chest LEDs.
5.  **Automated Eye Color Test Script (`tests/test_robot_eyes.py`):**
    *   Created script using `opencv-python` to connect to the robot, set eye colors, and capture images. Images saved to `test_results/eye_tests/<timestamp>/`.
    *   Added HTML report generation (`report.html`) for manual pass/fail verification, including AI predictions.
    *   Integrated audio feedback using `pygame`.
    *   Resolved Python import issues.
    *   Refined test execution timing and webcam handling.
    *   Integrated Ollama API calls (`gemma3:12b-it-qat`) for AI color prediction of captured images.
        *   AI predictions are logged and included in the HTML report.
        *   Initial tests show good results for primary colors (red, green, blue) but some inaccuracies for mixed/other colors (yellow, cyan, magenta, white, off).
6.  **Ollama Test Script (`tests/testOllama.py`):**
    *   Created and refined a script to test Ollama API with pre-existing images, confirming model accessibility and basic functionality.
7.  **GitHub Issue Management:**
    *   Discussed creating a GitHub issue for improving white balance in tests.
    *   Provided `gh cli` commands for issue and label creation.
    *   Created "tests" label in the repository.
8.  **Conversation Logging:**
    *   Created `docs/conversation_log_20250511.md` to store conversation summaries.

**PENDING / NEXT STEPS:**
1.  **User to create GitHub issue** for white balance improvement.
2.  **Consider improvements for AI color detection accuracy** (e.g., prompt engineering, lighting adjustments, exploring other models/fine-tuning if necessary).
3.  **Integrate Home Assistant control** for power cycling the robot during tests (new requirement).
4.  **Define and Test Robot Poses (Phase II, Step 5 from `ai-tasks.md`):**
    *   Define 3-5 distinct, achievable poses for the Meccanoid 2.0.
    *   Implement an `execute_pose(pose_name)` function in `src/robot_control.py` (or a new pose management module).
    *   Write a test script (e.g., `tests/test_robot_poses.py`) to cycle through and display these poses on the actual robot.
5.  **Continue with subsequent phases from `ai-tasks.md`:** Human Pose Estimation (Phase III), Core Game Logic (Phase IV), etc.

**CODE STATE (Key Files):**
